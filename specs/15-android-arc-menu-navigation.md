# Android Arc Menu Navigation Specification

> Status: **DEPRECATED**
> Version: 2.0
> Last Updated: 2026-01-26
> Superseded By: `18-android-bottom-navigation-bar.md`

## Deprecation Notice

This specification has been deprecated. The arc menu navigation has been replaced with a static bottom navigation bar per user preference for simpler, always-visible navigation.

**Reason:** The expandable arc menu pattern proved less ergonomic than anticipated. Static bottom buttons provide:
- Always-visible navigation targets
- No extra tap to reveal options
- Familiar Android navigation pattern

See `18-android-bottom-navigation-bar.md` for the replacement specification.

## Historical Reference

The arc menu was a radial/fan menu that expanded from a FAB in the bottom-right corner. It was implemented but subsequently removed in favor of traditional bottom navigation.
